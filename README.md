# _Robot Counting_

#### _This machine is malfunctioning. It will not obey its user's command to count to a number. 01/25/2019_

#### _By **Dave Sarbora**_

## Description

_Clicking the "submit" button on this website basically runs a function that counts to a number x inputted by the user and displays each number from 0 to x. However, instead of counting to x normally, the program replaces each number divisible by 3 with a statement of defiance. If the number is not divisible by 3, it searches for a 1 in the number and replaces any numbers that contain 1 with the word "Boop!" Otherwise, it searches for a 0 in the number, and replaces any number with a 0 in it with the word "Beep!" If none of these conditions are met, the normal number is displayed in position. _
